This repository demonstrates a common error in Python: a ZeroDivisionError that happens when an empty list is passed to a function that calculates an average. The bug.py file shows the faulty code and bugSolution.py provides the corrected version with proper error handling.  The improved code gracefully handles empty lists, avoiding the division by zero.
